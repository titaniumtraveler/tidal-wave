CLI to control Elgato Wave XLR via USB

## Warning

This is a project I made on one week end, having never worked with neither
wireshark, nor USB (on this level that is) before that.

It works on my linux machine with the Elgato Wave XLR firmware version `1.3.4`,
but I can't guarantie anything beyond that.
